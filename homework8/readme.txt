Homework Token #2: Used
Implemented:
- Letters are randomly generated: generateHand() first checks to see if the letter is available then randomly generates a tile
- Tiles can be dragged and dropped : I used the draggable and droppable features in JQuery
- Board includes bonus squares: Board created with two bonus squares
- Clear all button for reset: Refreshes page
- Takes can only be dragged from the rack to Scrabble Board: Will bounce back if the space cannot be occupied
- Once a tile is placed, it cannot be moved: This is due to the revert: invalid feature in JQuery droppable and draggable functions
- Once a space is occupied, the piece bounces back: This is due to out function

I did not implement all of the features. I did not want to lose too many points by taking more time to work on the assignment.
I am submitting the assignment incomplete. I started the assignment a few days ago and spent a long time reviewing material. I ran out of time
