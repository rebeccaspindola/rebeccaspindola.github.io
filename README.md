GUI

I completely overhauled my original webpage using bootstrap. Most of the styling is now done with bootstrap.
I also simplified the the layout. I am not done making changes to my webpage.
I would like to take things a step further by adding more responsive features as well as javascript.

HOMEWORK 6:

-Added JQuery validation
-Styled page using CSS
-Formatted page using Bootstrap
