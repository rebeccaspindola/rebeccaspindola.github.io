         <!--ABOUT ME SECTION-->
         <h2> Welcome<br> My name is Rebecca Alves <br>You  stumbled upon my first webpage <br> I was born in a small Brazilian town that you cannot locate on a map. I migrated with my family to america when I was very young. I spent most of my childhood and teenage yers in Framingham, MA. I absolutely love framingham, and I am very thankful for my expirience in the diverse enviroment. My favorite passtime activities are concerts, board games, video games, an playing guitar. I also venture on the occasional hike here and there. My board game collection contains over 40+ games. If you need an unconventional board game recommendation, I am your gal! I lost count of the amount of concerts I attended. The concerts I attend range from metal to alternative rock. You can convince me to see any band or performer live.
